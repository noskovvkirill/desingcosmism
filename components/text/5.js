 The principle behind everything, including human culture and history, is electricity, the power of electrons to attract, combine and form larger units of matter and energy. Gravity, magnetism, space-time, and matter-energy are all, fundamentally, electronic phenomena. The sun's influence on the biosphere, including on human behaviour, is a matter of the transfer of electrons. The discovery that patterns of solar activity - sun storms, sunspots - coincide with patterns of mass human behaviour - wars, revolutions, epidemics - represents, a large first step toward uniting "the science of matter" and "science of human culture", resulting in defining a single governing principle for the entire cosmos.
