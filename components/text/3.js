What would happen if man could make himself so submissive that he wholly rid himself of freedom? This would be the highest degree of human perfection. Every movement of his soul would then be produced by the principle which produced all other movements of the world. Thus, instead of being separated from nature, as he now is, man would fuse with it. Instead of the feeling of his own will, which separates him from the general order of things, which makes him being apart, he would find the feeling of universal will, the profound awareness of his real relation to the whole of creation.

Under what conditions, will I no longer mean domination or negation of all except oneself, and altruism no longer mean servitude or self-negation? Or: when will I (=egoism) no longer mean isolation (solipsism), and other( =altruism) no longer mean alienation, discord (separatism)?

The synthesis of egoism (individualism, solipsism) and altruism can be expressed by the joining of two words: “we” and “all”. When all will recognise themselves in all, and thereby become even more closely related, then will come multi-unity.
