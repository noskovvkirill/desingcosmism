The idea of active evolution, the necessity for a new conscious stage of development of the world, when humanity directs it on a course which reason and moral feeling determine, when man takes, so to say, the wheel of evolution into his own handsâ€¦ Man, for actively evolutionary thinkers, is a being in transition, in the process of growing, far from complete, but also consciously creative, called upon to overcome not only the outer world but also his own inner nature.

As we shift our perspective from an earrth-centered to a cosmos-centred view, emphasises that present humanity is not the end point of evolution, and in addition evolutionary process has a long future, and humanity is now in a position to direct and shape its own future evolution.`}/>
