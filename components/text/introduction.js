The nineteenth and early twentieth century saw the emergence of a controversial Russian school of thought, united in the conviction that humanity was entering a new stage of evolution in which it must take on a new, active, managerial role in the cosmos.

Supressed during the Soviet period and little noticed in the West, our aim was to rediscover the cosmist thought as we believed it might offer valuable perspective in times of crisis.

Major themes include the activation of mankind to direct and shape its own future evolution; the profound awareness of his real relation to the whole of creation, abandoning egoism and turning towards multiunity; the establishment of spiritual union through physical union by balancing masculine and feminine principles in every individual; the indefinite extension of human life span to establish universal immortality and the effect of cosmic rays and currently unrecognised particles of energy on human history.
