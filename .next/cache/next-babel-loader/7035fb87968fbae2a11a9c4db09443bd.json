Gravity, magnetism, space-time, and matter-energy are all, fundamentally, electronic phenomena. The sun's influence on the biosphere, including on human behaviour, is a matter of the transfer of electrons. The discovery that patterns of solar activity - sun storms, sunspots - coincide with patterns of mass human behaviour - wars, revolutions, epidemics - represents, a large first step toward uniting 'the science of matter' and 'science of human culture', resulting in defining a single governing principle for the entire cosmos.\"]\n\n\n  \n\n  const objects = [<OneContainer clickOne={NextObject}/>,\n                  <TwoContainer clickOne={NextObject}/>,\n                  <ThreeContainer clickOne={NextObject}/>,\n                  <FourContainer clickOne={NextObject}/>,\n                  <FiveContainer clickOne={NextObject}/>,\n                  <SixContainer clickOne={NextObject}/>]\n              \n\n\n  return (\n   <Layout>\n    <main>\n      <div className='object-main'>\n      <div className='object-text'>\n        <p>{descriptions[objectDisplay]}</p>\n        <div className='object-text-three'>\n        {objects[objectDisplay]}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n          <div className='object-three' ref={ref}>\n            <motion.div>\n            \n           \n            {/* <AnimatePresence> */}\n              {objects.map((object, index)=>{\n                return(\n                  <React.Fragment key={index}>\n                  {object}\n                  </React.Fragment>\n                  )\n              })}\n            {/* </AnimatePresence> */}\n\n\n            </motion.div>\n          </div>\n          \n        </div>\n        <div className=\"audio\">\n      <AWSSoundPlayer\n            streamUrl={streamUrl}\n            preloadType=\"auto\" />\n      </div>\n      </main>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Index\n\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
