Gravity, magnetism, space-time, and matter-energy are all, fundamentally, electronic phenomena. The sun's influence on the biosphere, including on human behaviour, is a matter of the transfer of electrons. The discovery that patterns of solar activity - sun storms, sunspots - coincide with patterns of mass human behaviour - wars, revolutions, epidemics - represents, a large first step toward uniting 'the science of matter' and 'science of human culture', resulting in defining a single governing principle for the entire cosmos</p>\n        <div className='object-text-three'>\n        {objectDisplay[objectDisplay]}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n          <div className='object-three'>\n            <AnimatePresence>\n              {objects.map((object, index)=>{\n                return(\n                  <React.Fragment key={index} onClick={(e)=>{\n                    e.preventDefault(); \n                    NextObject()}}>\n                  {object}\n                  </React.Fragment>\n                  )\n              })}\n            </AnimatePresence>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"audio\">\n      <AWSSoundPlayer\n            streamUrl={streamUrl}\n            preloadType=\"auto\" />\n      </div>\n      </main>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Index\n\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
